## Description

The Pizza Ordering System is a web-based application that allows users to browse a menu of pizzas, rate them, add them to their order, and complete a payment process. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive user experience, including star ratings, item quantity adjustments, and a modal payment form.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: Displays pizza items with images, ingredients, ratings, and prices.
- **Quantity Control**: Allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of each dish using plus/minus buttons.
- **Star Ratings**: Users can rate each dish from 1 to 5 stars. Ratings are saved to local storage.
- **Order Summary**: The application maintains a real-time order summary that shows the items selected, their quantities, and the total price.
- **Payment Modal**: A modal is triggered when the user completes their order, allowing them to enter their payment details.
- **Order Reset**: Users can reset their order and start a new one after completing a payment.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, including layout, animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features such as the menu, order tracking, and the payment modal.
